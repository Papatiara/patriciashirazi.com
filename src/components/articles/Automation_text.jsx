                    <p>Every single feature you see here, from animations to the background design, was made by me. I didnâ€™t use any template or copied and pasted from the internet, not that I don't think it is valid. At the end of the day, we all want to deliver great work, don't overpass our deadlines, and I believe there is no reason to redo a work that is available online.
Because I wanted to take my time and revisit some skills, such as React Hooks, I decided to build this WebApp from scratch.</p>
